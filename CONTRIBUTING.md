## I want to help out

Fantastic! Issues tagged with `help wanted` are ready to be picked up. If you have other ideas on how to improve please reach out in an issue :)

## I need installation help

Yopass is deployed as a docker container which means very little configuration is needed if you know docker.
If that's not the case I suggest you start by learning how to run a docker container and how to expose ports.
There's also a docker-compose.yaml file available in the deploy folder which make the basic setup very easy.
I do offer any help installing the service more then the already supplied installation instructions.
Improvements to the installation instructions are _always_ welcome.
